## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Scope

DroneOperationsCentral focuses exclusively on the mission management and reporting aspects of drone operations:

* **Mission Planning and Configuration**: Defining survey areas, configuring flight paths, and setting data collection parameters
* **Fleet Visualization and Management**: Displaying the organization's drone inventory with real-time status information
* **Real-time Mission Monitoring**: Visualizing drone flight paths and mission progress in real time
* **Survey Reporting and Analytics**: Presenting comprehensive survey summaries and performance metrics

*Note: Viewing live video feed, actual collection of survey data (images/videos), and the generation of maps/models are outside the scope of this project.*

### 2.2 Problem Statement

Organizations operating drone fleets for survey operations face significant challenges:

1. **Complex Mission Planning**: Defining precise survey areas and optimal flight paths requires specialized knowledge
2. **Fleet Management Overhead**: Tracking drone status, maintenance, and availability across a fleet is time-consuming
3. **Limited Visibility During Missions**: Without real-time monitoring, operators lack crucial information during missions
4. **Data Analysis Complexity**: Extracting actionable insights from mission data requires substantial manual effort

DroneOperationsCentral addresses these challenges through an integrated, user-centric platform that simplifies these complex tasks and provides comprehensive visualization and management tools.
